An organic wine is one whose production is free of artificial or harmful chemicals for the vineyards or the people who work in them.

Anyone who produces organic wine deserves applause, because they are not thinking only of themselves or the present moment; He is thinking about the planet, about future generations and he is also finally thinking about us who in the glass serve an increasingly careful wine from the planet. Azienda Agricola La Fontursia has had these certifications for years since its vineyards have respected the Biological process for generations. Unique grape varieties such as “Passerina” or “Pecorino” make these Organic wines, certified by the EU, an international benchmark of know-how, in total respect for the environment."
