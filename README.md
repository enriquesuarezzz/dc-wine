🧠 Firebase Setup
For Firestore, create a collection for storing wine products. Each product can have the following structure:

{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": "Wine Name",
  "description": "Wine Description",
  "price": 100,
  "image_url": "https://example.com/wine-image.jpg",
  "type": "red | white | sparkling"
}
 ```

### 💸 Stripe Integration
The Stripe integration allows users to complete their orders by securely entering their payment information.

Frontend: The user adds wines to the cart, proceeds to checkout, and submits payment via Stripe.
Backend: The payment is processed via the Stripe API. After successful payment, the order is confirmed.
